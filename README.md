# Methods

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Connection

### new

**syntax:** `hp, err = httpipe:new(chunk_size?, sock?)`

Creates the httpipe object. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

The argument, `chunk_size`, specifies the buffer size used by cosocket reading operations. Defaults to `8192`.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### connect

`syntax: ok, err = hp:connect(host, port, options_table?)`

`syntax: ok, err = hp:connect("unix:/path/to/unix.sock", options_table?)`

Attempts to connect to the web server.

Before actually resolving the host name and connecting to the remote backend, this method will always look up the connection pool for matched idle connections created by previous calls of this method.

An optional Lua table can be specified as the last argument to this method to specify various connect options:

* `pool`
: Specifies a custom name for the connection pool being used. If omitted, then the connection pool name will be generated from the string template `<host>:<port>` or `<unix-socket-path>`.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### set_timeout

**syntax:** `hp:set_timeout(time)`

Sets the timeout (in ms) protection for subsequent operations, including the `connect` method.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### ssl_handshake

**syntax:** `hp:ssl_handshake(reused_session?, server_name?, ssl_verify?)`

Does SSL/TLS handshake on the currently established connection.

See more: <http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#tcpsock:sslhandshake>

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### set_keepalive

**syntax:** `ok, err = hp:set_keepalive(max_idle_timeout, pool_size)`

Attempts to puts the current connection into the ngx_lua cosocket connection pool.

**Note** Normally, it will be called automatically after processing the request. In other words, we cannot release the connection back to the pool unless you consume all the data.

You can specify the max idle timeout (in ms) when the connection is in the pool and the maximal size of the pool every nginx worker process.

In case of success, returns 1. In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### get_reused_times

**syntax:** `times, err = hp:get_reused_times()`

This method returns the (successfully) reused times for the current connection. In case of error, it returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

If the current connection does not come from the built-in connection pool, then this method always returns `0`, that is, the connection has never been reused (yet). If the connection comes from the connection pool, then the return value is always non-zero. So this method can also be used to determine if the current connection comes from the pool.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### close

**syntax:** `ok, err = hp:close()`

Closes the current connection and returns the status.

In case of success, returns `1`. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)


## Requesting

### request

**syntax:** `res, err = hp:request(opts?)`

**syntax:** `res, err = hp:request(host, port, opts?)`

**syntax:** `res, err = hp:request("unix:/path/to/unix-domain.socket", opts?)`

The `opts` table accepts the following fields:

* `version`: Sets the HTTP version. Use `10` for HTTP/1.0 and `11` for HTTP/1.1. Defaults to `11`.
* `method`: The HTTP method string. Defaults to `GET`.
* `path`: The path string. Default to `/`.
* `query`: Specifies query parameters. Accepts either a string or a Lua table.
* `headers`: A table of request headers. Accepts a Lua table.
* `body`: The request body as a string, or an iterator function.
* `read_timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network read operations specially.
* `send_timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network send operations specially.
* `stream`: If set to `true`, return an iterable `res.body_reader` object instead of `res.body`.
* `maxsize`: Sets the maximum size in bytes to fetch. A response body larger than this will cause the fucntion to return a `exceeds maxsize` error. Defaults to nil which means no limit.
* `ssl_verify`: A Lua boolean value to control whether to perform SSL verification.

When the request is successful, `res` will contain the following fields:

* `res.status` (number): The resonse status, e.g. 200
* `res.headers` (table): A Lua table with response headers.
* `res.body` (string): The plain response body.
* `res.body_reader` (function): An iterator function for reading the body in a streaming fashion.
* `res.pipe` (httpipe): A new http pipe which use the current `body_reader` as input body by default.

**Note** All headers (request and response) are noramlized for capitalization - e.g., Accept-Encoding, ETag, Foo-Bar, Baz - in the normal HTTP "standard."

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### request_uri

**syntax:** `res, err = hp:request_uri(uri, opts?)`

The simple interface. Options supplied in the `opts` table are the same as in the generic interface, and will override components found in the uri itself.

Returns a res object as same as `hp:request` method.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### res.body_reader

The `body_reader` iterator can be used to stream the response body in chunk sizes of your choosing, as follows:

````lua
local reader = res.body_reader

repeat
  local chunk, err = reader(8192)
  if err then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
    break
  end

  if chunk then
    -- process
  end
until not chunk
````

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### send_request

**syntax:** `ok, err = hp:send_request(opts?)`

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### read_response

**syntax:** `local res, err = hp:read_response(callback?)`

The `callback` table accepts the following fields:

* `header_filter`: A callback function for response headers filter

````lua
local res, err = hp:read_response{
    header_filter = function (status, headers)
        if status == 200 then
        	return 1
        end
end }
````

* `body_filter`: A callback function for response body filter

````lua
local res, err = hp:read_response{
    body_filter = function (chunk)
        ngx.print(chunk)
    end
}
````

Additionally there is no ability to stream the response body in this method. If the response is successful, res will contain the following fields: `res.status`, `res.headers`, `res.body`.

**Note** When return true in callback function，filter process will be interrupted.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### read

**syntax:** `local typ, res, err = hp:read()`

Streaming parser for the full response.

The user just needs to call the read method repeatedly until a nil token type is returned. For each token returned from the read method, just check the first return value for the current token type. The token type can be `statusline`, `header`, `header_end`, `body`, `body_end` and `eof`. About the format of `res` value, please refer to the above example. For example, several body tokens holding each body data chunk, so `res` value is equal to the body data chunk.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### eof

**syntax:** `local eof = hp:eof()`

If return `true` indicating already consume all the data; Otherwise, the request there is still no end, you need call `hp:close` to close the connection forcibly.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Utility

### parse_uri

**syntax:** `local scheme, host, port, path, args = unpack(hp:parse_uri(uri))`

This is a convenience function allowing one to more easily use the generic interface, when the input data is a URI.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### get_client_body_reader

**syntax:** `reader, err = hp:get_client_body_reader(chunk_size?)`

Returns an iterator function which can be used to read the downstream client request body in a streaming fashion. For example:

```lua
local req_reader = hp:get_client_body_reader()

repeat
  local chunk, err = req_reader(8192)
  if err then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
    break
  end

  if chunk then
    -- process
  end
until not chunk
```

This iterator can also be used as the value for the body field in request params, allowing one to stream the request body into a proxied upstream request.

```lua
local client_body_reader, err = hp:get_client_body_reader()

local res, err = hp:request{
   path = "/helloworld",
   body = client_body_reader,
}
```
